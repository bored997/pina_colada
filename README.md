===========
pina colada attempts to detect the amount of fingers being held up.

## Dependencies
* **Visual Studio 2015**
* **[OpenCV 3.1.0](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)** (and up)

## Building

After grabbing a prebuilt version of OpenCV 3, set an environment variable `OPENCV_DIR` to the directory containing `bin` and `lib`. On the author's machine, this is `C:\libs\opencv\build\x64\vc14`. The additional include and library directories in the VS solution are set according to that environment variable.
